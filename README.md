# Blobstream Rollup Example

This program verifies a transaction using a rollup. It fetches the transaction from the Celestia network, generates a data root inclusion proof, and verifies the proof on the BlobstreamX contract on the Ethereum network.


## Running a rollup example

```shell
$ make start
```
